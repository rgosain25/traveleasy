 # Full Project Description: 

The brainstorming session for a breakthrough Idea allotted being 1 hour, put us into some weird thinking. 
So, we thought, what’s the latest issue being faced by all and still we haven’t reached a potential solution yet? 
Since, people are really not willing to switch to public transport for obvious reasons, we decided to change this thinking. 
When our own Honorable Chief Minister is seeking help for this traffic problem, we have given it a shot to go about changing 
the mindsets. Travel Easy makes use of existing plying public transportation and tries to bring them together at one place. 
After some lookup on the internet we observed- There wasn’t any platform to compare these services. 
People don’t have a definite and summarized review of the services. 
Putting all these together, could enhance the productivity of public transport. 
So, what exactly it does. 
It simply takes in the source and destination desired by the user and 
it magically prints out the cost of using each service, bringing them all at one place, 
hence letting user to choose the better service according to the needs. 
It let’s the users know of different means they have to travel.
Also, there’s a big potential to control out the rates and even bring them at competitive prices considering the people 
have choices. 
The revenue model can be built around the fact that companies would try to have a solid following here and a good service nature.
